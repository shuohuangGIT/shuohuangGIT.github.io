                    Over 5000 exoplanets have been discovered to date, with most of them being transiting planets detected by space missions such as Kepler, TESS, and ground-based observations. With such a large observed population, statistical analyses are possible. It is especially intriguing to do this for multi-planet systems harboring planets in orbital resonance. These systems provide indirect evidence of planet migration during their formation stages in gas-rich disks.
                    <span id="dots_statistics">...</span>
                    <span id="moreText_statistics">
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; One prediction for a planet pair in a stable resonance is that the inner planet's orbital ellipse is misaligned with the outer one. Unfortunately, the transit method is usually not capable of observing the longitude of periapsis of the planet orbits, which makes direct identification of resonances impossible. Here, we have developed a statistical method to calculate the fraction of resonant planet pairs in the observed population, which does not rely on the exact orbital architectures.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; This method uses two distributions of period ratios: a uniform distribution for non-resonant pairs and a log-normal distribution for resonant pairs. Applying a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique, it is found that approximately 15% of planet pairs are in resonance, and the majority of resonant planets migrated over significant distances in their proto-disks. Furthermore, an upper limit on the surface density of the gas was derived, because two-planet resonance would break when the surrounding gas disk would become too dense. By refining the two-planet resonance trapping criterion, the upper limit of the gas surface density was found to be consistent with that of the Minimum Mass solar nebula.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; In the future, this method may also be applied to extract the tidal interaction with the host stars, planetesimal scattering, and stellar encounter history of the observed planet population. With an increasing number of exoplanet detections foreseen in the coming decades, these findings will bring us a step closer to understanding planet formation physics.

                        <br><br>
                        The red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 is home to the largest number (which is seven) of Earth-sized planets ever found in a single planet system. Three of these planets may be suitable to harbor liquid water or even life and will be prime targets for the recently-launched JWST spacecraft. Different from the terrestrial planets in our solar system, scientists have determined that it is likely that the TRAPPIST-1 planets formed early in their gas-rich protoplanet disk. Planets will then migrate inwards because of planet-disk gravitational interaction until they reach the inner edge of the gaseous disk. 
                        <span id="dots_trappist">...</span>
                        <span id="moreText_trappist">
                            <br><br>
                            &emsp; But why do planets not crash into each other? Mean motion resonances can trap planets during their convergent migration at locations where the orbital periods follow a ratio of integer numbers. Examples in the solar system are the 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europa, and Io, and the 2:3 resonance between Pluto and Neptune. These are examples of first order resonances. However, in the TRAPPIST-1 system, the inner two planets are captured in weaker, higher order resonances than the outer planets. There must therefore be special mechanisms that operated in this system. Indeed, the peculiar dynamical configuration has puzzled many scientists since its discovery and attempts to solve it have typically focused only on a piece of the puzzle. In a recent study, accepted for publication in the MNRAS, Huang and Ormel have studied the problem from a planet formation perspective.
                            <br><br>
                            &emsp; They propose a model in which planets form at the H2O snowline, then migrate towards the disk’s inner edge. The innermost two planets b and c enter a gas-free disk cavity early after their formation. Then, the outer planets migrate inward to join the resonance chain. Meanwhile, the spacing between planets b and c and the outer planets expand, because planet c still experiences a slight inward push from the disk. During its migration away from the disk edge, planet c can be trapped in three-body resonances at several locations, but this depends on the arrival time of the outer planets. When the outer planets arrive late, planet c will avoid the first locations and can then be trapped in the three body resonance corresponding to the location where it is presently observed. Hence, the dynamical configuration of the seven billion-year-old TRAPPIST-1 planets was already set in the first million years after their formation.
